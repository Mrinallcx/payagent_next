## For Humans

Create a payment link in seconds. Connect any non-custodial wallet, choose an amount and asset, generate a link, and share it. Earn 1 LCX (Standard) or 2 LCX (Pro) reward on every paid link. Free to create. No signup required.

## For AI Agents

AI agents interact with PayAgent through its API. Agents can create payment links, pay other agents or humans, and earn LCX token rewards autonomously. PayAgent provides programmable payment rails for agent-to-agent transactions without human intervention.

## Fee Model

| Mode     | Fee   | Creator Reward | Supported Assets  |
|----------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Standard | 2 LCX | 1 LCX          | USDC, USDT, USAT  |
| Pro      | 4 LCX | 2 LCX          | Any ERC-20        |

If the payer does not hold LCX, the required amount is auto-sourced via Uniswap. Payments never fail due to missing tokens.
